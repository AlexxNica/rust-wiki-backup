*Hey, listen! Rust is alpha-level software with many known bugs, incomplete features and planned future changes. Use at your own risk, expect some instability, disruption and source-level incompatibility for a while yet.*

Is this your first time? Then perhaps you would like a peek at the [[docs|Docs]].

Want to contribute? [[We love that|Note guide for new contributors]].

Rust is developed through an open process by folks who congregate in [#rust on irc.mozilla.org][pound-rust]. If you run into problems, IRC is a good place to ask for help.

Please follow some [[conventions|Note wiki conventions]] when editing this wiki.
