## Rust

*Hey, Listen! Rust is alpha-level software with many known bugs, incomplete features and planned future changes. Use at your own risk, expect some instability, disruption and source-level incompatibility for a while yet.*

If this is your first time then perhaps you would like a peek at the [[docs|Docs]].

Rust is developed through a completely open process by friendly people who congregate at [#rust on irc.mozilla.org][pound-rust]. If you run into problems, IRC is the best place ask for help.

If you want to hack on Rust itself then read the [[getting started guide for Rust developers|Note getting started developing Rust]].

If you intend to edit this wiki, please follow some [[conventions|Note wiki conventions]].
