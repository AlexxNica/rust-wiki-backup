Listing of bikeshed topics

These tend to be either syntax issues, more-superficial features, or "wish list" thinking, wherein we haven't quite decided what we even want to do yet, and are collecting ideas, requirement-lists, contradictory approaches, opinions, etc.

When you're done with a bikeshed page, please either abandon it or move it to a proposal or note.
