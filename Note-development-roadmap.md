This page used to cover early (pre-0.1) tasks on the development roadmap for Rust. It is now an outline of where we plan to take the compiler over the course of the next several releases, ending in a 1.0 release that we commit to supporting over an extended time period. Where possible, we will link to bugs in the issue tracker.

Items on this page will move to the [[Doc detailed release notes]] page as they are completed.
