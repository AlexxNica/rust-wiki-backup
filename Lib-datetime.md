## 3. Research of libraries from other languages

  1. Language: C++/Boost
    - http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_53_0/doc/html/date_time.html
    - concepts
        - **Time Point** (a location in the time continuum)
        - **Time Duration **(a length of time)
        - **Time Interval/Period** (attached to a specific point in the time continuum)

  2. Language: Haskell

### Summary of research from other languages:
#### Structures and functions commonly appearing
#### Variations on implementation seen
#### Pitfalls and hazards associated with each variant
#### Relationship to other libraries and/or abstract interfaces
