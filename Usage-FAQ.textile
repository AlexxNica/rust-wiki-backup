h3. What does @Common.Semant_err(_, "unsatisfied 'use' clause")@ mean?

Usually it means that Rust couldn't find the library you linked to. If you get this with @use std;@, make sure that you're providing the full path to the standard library on the command line (e.g. @rustboot -L /path/to/rust/src myprog.rs@).

h3. What does it mean when a program exits with @leaked memory in rust main loop (2 objects)' failed, rt/memory_region.cpp:99 2 objects@?

If the previous lines of output indicate failure, probably nothing. It just means the program stopped with an error. Particularly if it's coming from rustc. Rustc is compiled in 'minimal' mode, a hackish mode of rustboot in which we've disabled the unwinder (and numerous other optional cost centers). This means that when rustc encounters a 'fail' statement or any other sort of failure-inducing condition, it exits abruptly, rather than unwinding carefully. The runtime is just complaining about unfreed memory it would normally expect to be free, were the unwinder enabled.

This is a temporary hack and will be removed.
