h3. What does it mean when a program exits with @leaked memory in rust main loop (2 objects)' failed, rt/memory_region.cpp:99 2 objects@?

This message indicates a memory leak, and is mostly likely to happen on rarely exercised failure paths. Note that failure unwinding is not yet implemented on windows so this is expected. If you see this on linux or mac it's a compiler bug; please report it.

h3. Why does my build fail with a "bad hash on download" message?

This happens when the snapshot compiler failed to download correctly so doesn't have the correct hash. To fix it just delete the mentioned tar.bz2 file from the dl folder in your build directory and run make again.
