* [Rust Rosetta](https://github.com/Hoverbear/rust-rosetta) - Also fairly complete.
* [The official cheatsheet](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/complement-cheatsheet.html)
* [Getting Rusty](http://pzol.github.io/getting_rusty/)
* [Rust by Example (TheHydroImpulse)](http://rustbyexample.github.io/)
