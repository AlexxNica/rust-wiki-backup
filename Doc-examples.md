This is the most complete:

* [Rust by Example (japaric)](https://rustbyexample.github.io)

And these also have good examples:

* [The official cheatsheet](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/complement-cheatsheet.html)
* [Getting Rusty](http://pzol.github.io/getting_rusty/)
* [Rust by Example (TheHydroImpulse)](http://rustbyexample.github.io/)
* [Rust by Example (cjschneider2)](https://github.com/cjschneider2/rust-by-example)
* [Rust Rosetta](https://github.com/Hoverbear/rust-rosetta)
* [Rust for Real](https://github.com/flaper87/rust-for-real)
