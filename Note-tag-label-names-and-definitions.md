The word "Issues" encompassed both bugs and feature requests.

If the meaning is blank, then the meaning is implicit in the name
(contribute a clarifying definition if you believe the meaning is not
self-evident).

If the meaning is a "?", then Felix did not immediately know the
meaning of the label and does not think it is self-evident.
