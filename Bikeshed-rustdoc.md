rustdoc currently needs some love, and I'm going to give it some.

# Architecture

- take AST, make pretty docs. easy!

# Pain points with current rustdoc

- `Implementation of Foo for Bar where <useless stuff>` (from SL. where -> given?) 

# New features

- Unformatted JSON/XML (undecided) output
- More complete TOCs, indexes, links to all items documented
- Interactive browser interface (live search, toggle platform cfg's)
- every symbol should be able to be linked to its documentation (eg, types, methods, functions)
- new attribute that instructs rustdoc to inline a nested module into its parent's documentation
- your feature requests here!
