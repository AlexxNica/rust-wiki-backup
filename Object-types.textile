* We currently have structural object types.

* There's no current way to make them recursive. For example, you can't write the type of an object that has a clone method that returns the same type again.

* Just as with [[disjoint union types]], introducing recursive structural types makes for a much more complicated type system.

* We could consider adding interface types, which would be nominal object types that could be recursive, and we could allow objects to be annotated as implementing specific interfaces.

* As a convenience, we could also implicitly bind every object constructor to an interface type of the same name, where instances are automatically implementations of that type.
