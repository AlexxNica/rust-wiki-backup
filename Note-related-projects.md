A listing of various rust-related projects that aren't in cargo so I can keep track of them

* [Prism's pastebin](http://kib2.free.fr/pastebin) - A pastebin instance that support Rust syntax highlighting using the Prism library
* [dyluke's textmate bundle](https://github.com/DylanLukes/Rust.tmbundle) - Rust TextMate mode
* [Erik Rose's BBEdit plugin](https://github.com/erikrose/rust-bbedit-plugin) - Plugin for BBEdit. Probably quite out of date.
