Rust has a community-driven development process where most decisions are made through consensus, under the stewardship of a 'core team'. The core team is responsible for steering the design and development process, overseeing the introduction of new features, and ultimately making decisions for which there is no consensus.

All of the core team is currently employed by Mozilla.
