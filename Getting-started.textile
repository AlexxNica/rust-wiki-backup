h3. Prerequisites

Version numbers listed here are "what we're using"; the code may well work with earlier versions of these tools, we do not know minimum version requirements.

* A recent linux, OSX or win32 system.
* Python 3.1 ("download link":http://www.python.org/download/)
* Ocaml 3.11 ("download link":http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html)
* GNU make 3.81
* g++ 4.4
* Valgrind 3.5 (recommended but not required for linux)
* Texinfo's makeinfo and/or texi2pdf commands, if you wish to build HTML or PDF docs, respectively

h4. Debian-based Linux distributions

@sudo apt-get install ocamlc@

64-bit systems: @sudo apt-get install g++-multilib@.

h4. Windows

We recommend developing under the "TDM mingw repackaging":http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/ as it has newer tools.

h3. Downloading and building

<pre>
<code>
$ git clone git@github.com:graydon/rust.git
$ cd rust/src
$ make check
</code>
</pre>
This will build and test the bootstrap compiler and standard library.

*Note:* on linux, if you have valgrind installed, the tests will run slowly because they are running under valgrind. If you define NO_VALGRIND=1 in your build environment, you can see the tests running at "full" speed (though of course, the bootstrap compiler generates terrible code).
</pre>

h3. Navigating

There's a quick guide to the source of the bootstrap compiler in src/boot/README, you should probably give it a read if you're going to be looking around the compiler.

h3. Dealing with the issue tracker

The github issue tracker is somewhat weak. However, it exposes itself through an API and there's a "secondary front-end that is quite a bit more responsive":http://githubissues.heroku.com/#graydon/rust

h3. Picking something interesting to do

Bugs in the tracker tagged as "easy" and/or "cleanup" are a good way to get your feet wet.

h3. Communicating

Join irc.mozilla.org #rust if you want to discuss anything more "interactively", we try to remain on that channel during working hours in UTC-7 (US Pacific).

Join the "mailing list":https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/rust-dev if you want to have longer conversations.

In both cases, please follow the conduct guidelines on the [[Development policy]] page.
