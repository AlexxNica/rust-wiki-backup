h3. Prerequisites

Version numbers listed here are "what we're using"; the code may well work with earlier versions of these tools, we do not know minimum version requirements.

* A recent linux, OSX or win32 system.
* Python 3.1 ("download link":http://www.python.org/download/)
* Ocaml 3.11 ("download link":http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html)
* GNU make 3.81
* g++ 4.4
* Valgrind 3.5 (recommended but not required for linux)
* Texinfo's makeinfo and/or texi2pdf commands, if you wish to build HTML or PDF docs, respectively

h4. Debian-based Linux distributions

@sudo apt-get install ocamlc@

64-bit systems: @sudo apt-get install g++-multilib@.

h4. Windows

We recommend developing under the "TDM mingw repackaging":http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/ as it has newer tools.

h3. Downloading and building

<pre>
<code>
$ git clone git@github.com:graydon/rust.git
$ cd rust/src
$ make check
</code>
</pre>
This will build and test the bootstrap compiler and standard library.

*Note:* on linux, if you have valgrind installed, the tests will run slowly because they are running under valgrind. If you define NO_VALGRIND=1 in your build environment, you can see the tests running at "full" speed (though of course, the bootstrap compiler generates terrible code).
