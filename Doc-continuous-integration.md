Rust is a fast-moving project and it can still be difficult for package maintainers to keep up with the Rust master branch. We recommend that maintainers use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) to test their packages against Rust nightly builds and register with the [Rust CI](http://hiho.io/rust-ci/) community dashboard. See the Rust CI page for further instructions.
