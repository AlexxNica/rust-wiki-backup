# Existing implementations

- [.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io%28v=vs.71%29.aspx)
- [Go](http://golang.org/pkg/io/) - They use very fine-grained interfaces
- Plan 9 BIO - 'Second-system' tried to do unix I/O right
- Common Lisp - 'overengineered'
- C++ streams - Probably don't want to take a lot of influence from C++

# Types of I/O streams

- File
- TCP
- UDP
- Memory buffer
- Strings
- Compressors/decompressors
- Encryption
