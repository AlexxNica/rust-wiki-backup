One or more core developers spend one day per week mopping up accumulated mess in the bug tracking system. This includes:

  - Initial triage: tagging, assigning, setting milestones, and eliminating incoming duplicates.
  - Source alignment: making FIXMEs in code correspond to bug numbers and vice versa.
  - Reproduction: checking locally to see if bugs are still valid.
  - Followup: requesting clarification, testcases, etc. from reporters of unclear bugs. 
  - Actual fixing: if there's any time left, pick some work off that seems fixable in short order.
  - Documentation: perhaps leave a note on this wiki page about what you did, for the next janitor's benefit.
